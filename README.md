# Basic Excercies (GitHub Actions Demo)

This repository showcases the power of GitHub Actions, inspired by the Udemy course on automating workflows. 

It includes a variety of GitHub Actions workflows each tailored to showcase different aspects of automation and CI/CD best practices.

## Workflows Overview

Each workflow is designed for specific tasks ranging from testing, building, deploying, to optimizing performance. Below are the detailed descriptions of each workflow present in this repository:

### Artifacts Download (`artifacts.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Activated on push to `main` or `master` branches.
- **Description:** Manages the entire lifecycle of testing, building, and deploying an application, including artifact handling.
- **Jobs:**
  - **Test:** Runs tests and lints code.
  - **Build:** Compiles the application and uploads necessary artifacts.
  - **Deploy:** Downloads the artifacts and deploys the application to the production environment.

### Caching (`caching1.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Activated on push to `main` or `master` branches.
- **Description:** Utilizes caching for dependencies to enhance the speed of the build process.
- **Jobs:**
  - **Test:** Installs dependencies from cache or reinstalls if cache is not hit, then performs linting and testing.
  - **Build:** Uses cached dependencies to build the application.

### Execution Flow (`execution-flow.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Activated on push to `main` or `master` branches.
- **Description:** Orchestrates the complete execution flow from linting to deployment, ensuring continued operation even if intermediate steps fail.
- **Jobs:**
  - **Lint, Test, Build, Deploy:** Sequential tasks with conditional continuations.
  - **Report:** Generates reports on failure to assist in debugging.

### Optimized Workflow (`optimized.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Activated on push to `main` or `master` branches.
- **Description:** Optimizes testing and building by leveraging caching and efficient task execution strategies.
- **Jobs:**
  - **Test and Build:** Simultaneously tests and builds the application, proceeding only on success.
  - **Deploy:** Deploys the successfully built application.

### Reusable Components (`reusable.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Activated on push to `main` or `master` branches.
- **Description:** Demonstrates the efficiency of reusing workflow components to avoid redundancy and speed up processes.
- **Jobs:**
  - **Lint and Test:** Performs linting and runs tests using cached dependencies.
  - **Build and Deploy:** Builds and deploys the application, ensuring efficient use of resources.

### Use and Reuse (`useReuse.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Activated on push to `main` or `master` branches.
- **Description:** Maximizes the reuse of configurations and steps across different jobs within the workflow to maintain efficiency.
- **Jobs:**
  - **Test:** Tests the application using cached dependencies.
  - **Build:** Builds the application using results and caches from the test job.
  - **Deploy:** Deploys using the artifacts generated from the build job.

### Continuous Execution (`continue.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Activated on push to `main` or `master` branches.
- **Description:** Ensures that all jobs are executed continuously, allowing subsequent steps to proceed even if previous ones fail.
- **Jobs:**
  - **Lint, Test, Build, Deploy:** Ensures continuous integration and deployment pipeline flow, with error handling and continuation capabilities.
